VISITOR INFORMATION
A tour of the entire memorial takes approximately one hour and thirty minutes. The visit could take longer, depending on the size of your group.

The Kigali Genocide Memorial welcomes visitors 365 days a year. However, there may be circumstances that require the memorial to be closed temporarily (e.g security reasons for VIP visitors). In the case of unexpected closures, all bookings are reviewed and visitors or tourism companies are contacted ahead of time to make alternative arrangements.

The memorial is open seven days a week, however on the last Saturday of every month, the memorial is open from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm due to Umuganda, when all Rwandans meet to undertake community work. You can learn more about Umuganda at Rwandapedia.

Refreshments are available from the Memorial Cafe. The cafe offers a wide range of food and drinks, and proceeds go towards supporting the work of the memorial. You can view the cafe menu here.

About KGM
The Kigali Genocide Memorial includes three permanent exhibitions, the largest of which documents the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. There is also a children’s memorial and an exhibition on the history of genocidal violence around the world. The education centre, gardens, and Genocide Archive of Rwanda contribute to a meaningful tribute to those who perished, and provide a powerful educational experience for visitors.

The memorial has five primary objectives:

To provide a dignified place of burial for victims of the Genocide against the Tutsi
To inform and educate visitors about the causes, implementation and consequences of the genocide, and other genocides throughout history.
To teach visitors about what we can do to prevent future genocides.
To provide a documentation centre to record evidence of the genocide, testimonies of genocide survivors and details of genocide victims.
To provide support for survivors, in particular orphans and widows.
